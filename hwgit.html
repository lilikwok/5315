      <h2>What is GIT?</h2>
      <p><b>Git</b> is an Open Source Distributed Version Control System for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers in parallel, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files and store the code in all developers' computers as well as a central server.</p>

      <h2>Why do we need source code Version Control System?</h2>
      <p><b>Version Control System(VCS)</b> makes collaboration much easier as it allows every developer on a team to work in parallel and to merge all the changes into a common version. Developers no longer need to spend a great amount of time in finding the right files because VCS keeps only one version on developers' disk and allow them to revert and go back to an older version if needed. Besides, VCS requires a short description of what was changed when saving a new version of a project, helping all the collaborators in a team understand well how the project evolved between versions especially for long-term projects. Therefore, VCS is necessary for developers as it is helpful in collaborations, storing data and understanding the whole process.</p>

      <h2>Local and Remote Repository</h2>
      <p><B>Local repo</B> is on the developers' computer for only personal direct use and has all the files and the commit history, enabling full diffs, history review, and committing when offline.</p>
      <p><B>Remote repo</B> is shared by all the collaborators in a team. After developers push their code from local repo into a remote repository, every developers in the team can see and modify the code.</p>

      <h2>How to use GIT in Team Project? </h2>
      <p>For developers to collaborate in a team project, starting on the master branch, the first step is to create a new individual branch and check out the new branch. Then, they can start writing code and commit regularly, before fetching from the remote repo and rebase all their changes into one commit. Furthermore, once checking out and pulling from the master branch to update the latest version, developers can merge their own changes and push. Finally, with all the changes merged into the master branch, developers can safely delete their feature branches.</p>
